# Shrinking header on scroll

A shrinking header on scroll is a common UI pattern where a fixed header element at the top of the page smoothly transitions to a smaller size as the user scrolls down. This effect is often used to maximize screen real estate for the main content while keeping essential navigation or branding elements accessible. With CSS scroll-driven animations, this effect can be achieved in a declarative and performant way, by linking an animation to the scroll position of the document.

## How to implement

Here’s how to create a shrinking header on scroll:

1.  **Create a fixed header:** Start with a header element that is fixed to the top of the page and has a predefined height.

    ```html
    <header>HEADER</header>
    ```

    ```css
    header {
      position: fixed;
      height: 200px;
      top: 0;
      left: 0;
      right: 0;
    }
    ```

2.  **Define the shrink animation:** Create a CSS animation that changes the height of the header.

    ```css
    @keyframes shrink {
      to {
        height: 50px;
      }
    }
    ```

3.  **Apply the animation and scroll timeline:** Attach the animation to the header and use the `scroll()` function to link it to the document’s scroll position.

    ```css
    header {
      animation: shrink auto linear both;
      animation-timeline: scroll(block root);
    }
    ```

4.  **Set the `animation-range`:** Use the `animation-range` property to specify the scroll distance over which the animation should occur. For example, to shrink the header over the first 150 pixels of scrolling, you would use `animation-range: 0px 150px;`.

    ```css
    header {
      animation-range: 0px 150px;
    }
    ```

**Tip:** To prevent the content following the header from being obscured by it, add a `padding-top` to the `body` (or the main content container) that is equal to the initial height of the header.

**Tip:** To make sure the contents of the page scroll in sync with the shrinking header, set the `animation-range-end` to the difference between the start and end sizes. This ensures the animation completes precisely when the header reaches its final size. In this demo the header shrinks from `200px` to `50px`, so the `animation-range-end` is set to `150px`.

## Example code

```css
@keyframes shrink {
  to {
    height: 50px;
  }
}

header {
  animation: shrink auto linear both;
  animation-timeline: scroll(block root);
  animation-range: 0px 150px;
}
```

## Best Practices

When using scroll-driven animations, it's important to follow a few best practices to ensure a smooth and accessible experience:

- **DO** include feature detection: Not all browsers support scroll-driven animations. Use `@supports ((animation-timeline: scroll()) and (animation-range: 0% 100%))` to check for support and provide a fallback for browsers that don't support it.
  - The `(animation-range: 0% 100%)` check **MUST** be included here, to filter out browsers with only partial support.
  - **DO NOT** use the `scroll-timeline-polyfill` package for the fallback strategy as it is not feature complete and has a lot of known issues.
  - If the animation is only considered to be decorative, opt for Progressive Enhancement and **DO NOT** provide a fallback.
- **DO** respect user preferences: Some users prefer to have less motion on the web. Use the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to disable or reduce your animations for these users.
- **DO** try to animate only performant CSS properties: For the smoothest animations, stick to animating properties that can be handled by the browser's compositor thread, such as `transform` and `opacity`. Animating other properties like `width` or `height` can lead to performance issues.
- **DO** use the correct declaration order: When using the `animation` shorthand property, declare `animation-timeline` and `animation-range` *after* it to prevent the shorthand from resetting the timeline.

When using the `scroll()` function to create a scroll-driven animation:

- **OPTIONAL** be explicit about the scroller: When not targeting the nearest ancestor scroller, be explicit about which scroller you want to use with `scroll(root)` or `scroll(self)`.
  - When `root`, `nearest`, or `self` are not sufficient, use a named scroll-timeline.
- **OPTIONAL** be explicit about the axis to track: When not targeting the default `block` axis (such as in a horizontal scroller), be explicit about which axis to track with `scroll(block)` or `scroll(inline)`.

As for this use case specifically:

- The element that you animate **MUST** not be `position: static` or `position: relative` when using percentages in the `animation-range`.
  - This is because those elements are considered “in-flow”. Shrinking those elements as you scroll, would shrink the total scroll distance, thereby affecting the computed value of — for example — `10%` into the scroll.

## Browser support and fallback strategies

Browser support for Scroll-driven animations: Limited availability.
Supported by: Chrome 115 (Jul 2023), Edge 115 (Jul 2023), and Safari 26 (Sep 2025).
Unsupported in: Firefox.. Therefore, a fallback strategy is typically required.

For browsers that do not support scroll-driven animations, you can use a fallback to recreate the visual effects. The fallbacks are typically built with either a scroll listener (for ScrollTimeline effects) or the IntersectionObserver API (for ViewTimeline effects).

In browsers with built-in support for scroll-driven animations, ALWAYS use the native CSS implementation as those are more performant.

Note that not every effect can be recreated using the fallbacks approach.

For this use-case specifically, the following script applies the fallback for browsers that do not support scroll-driven animations. It uses a scroll listener to track the scroll position of the document over a distance of `150px` and updates the header's height accordingly.

```js
// Fallback for browsers that don't support scroll-driven animations
if (!CSS.supports('(animation-timeline: scroll()) and (animation-range: 0% 100%)')) {
  const header = document.querySelector('header');

  const initialHeight = 200;
  const finalHeight = 50;
  const scrollDistance = 150;

  window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
    const scrollY = window.scrollY;
    const scrollPercent = Math.min(1, scrollY / scrollDistance);
    const newHeight = initialHeight - (initialHeight - finalHeight) * scrollPercent;

    header.style.height = `${newHeight}px`;
  });
}
```

# State-Aware Sticky Headers

Sticky headers are a common UI pattern, but they often need to change their appearance when they become "stuck" to maintain readability or save space. Traditional solutions required JavaScript scroll listeners, which can cause performance issues. Modern CSS allows you to handle this natively using **Scroll State Queries**.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create the Sticky Container
You need a container that will act as the sticky element and the container for the scroll state query.

```html
<!-- Wrap in a section to define the containment area for the sticky element -->
<div class="section">
  <div class="sticky-container">
    <div class="sticky-header">
      Section Header
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <!-- Content goes here -->
  </div>
</div>
```

### 2. Apply CSS for Sticky Behavior and Container Type
Set `container-type: scroll-state` on the `position: sticky` element, not on its scrollable ancestor. Always specify a `container-name`, since these queries may be nested and unnamed containers will collide. You can also combine it with size queries, e.g., `container-type: scroll-state inline-size`.

```css
.sticky-container {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  /* MANDATORY: Always specify a container name to avoid collisions if CQs are nested */
  container-type: scroll-state;
  container-name: section-header;
  z-index: 10;
}

.sticky-header {
  /* Base styles for the header */
  background: #f0f0f0;
  padding: 20px;
  transition: background-color 0.3s, box-shadow 0.3s;
}
```

**Important:** The scroll state is queried by **descendants** of the scroll-state container. The styles in the `@container` query will not apply to the `.sticky-container` itself, but to its children (like `.sticky-header`). You cannot style the container element itself with its own scroll-state query.


### 3. Target the Stuck State
Use the `@container scroll-state(...)` query to apply styles when the header is stuck.

```css
/* Apply styles when the named container is stuck at the top */
@container section-header scroll-state(stuck: top) {
  .sticky-header {
    background: #0056b3;
    color: white;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.15);
  }
}
```

**Tip:** You can also use logical properties like `stuck: inset-block-start` or `stuck: inset-inline-start` to better support internationalization (i18n) and right-to-left (RTL) layouts by querying flow-relative edges rather than physical ones.

### Notes on Dimension Changes

Without scroll anchoring disabled, changing layout-affecting properties (height, padding, font-size) when stuck can cause visual flickering. Scroll anchoring on the in-flow content below the sticky element adjusts the scroll offset to compensate for the layout change, which pushes the element back out of its stuck position and triggers an oscillation.

Disable scroll anchoring on the parent of the sticky element to avoid this:

```css
.section {
  overflow-anchor: none;
}
```

Apply `overflow-anchor: none` to the direct parent of the `position: sticky` element, not to `:root` or `body`, which would disable scroll anchoring for the entire page. With this in place, you can freely change any property in the stuck state, including box-model properties and transforms.

DO NOT: Rely on `overflow-anchor: none` for elements stuck to the **bottom**. Scroll anchoring only compensates for layout shifts above the current scroll position, so it has no effect on bottom-stuck elements. Avoid changing box-model properties in the stuck state for bottom-stuck headers.

### Fallback strategies
Browser support for Container scroll-state queries: Limited availability.
Supported by: Chrome 133 (Feb 2025) and Edge 133 (Feb 2025).
Unsupported in: Firefox and Safari.

Scroll state queries are a progressive enhancement. In browsers that do not support `container-type: scroll-state`, the header will still stick to the top (due to `position: sticky`), but it will not visually transform. For most use cases, this is the recommended approach.

If stickiness is not essential, but `position: sticky` without different styling would be a worse experience than no stickiness at all, you can wrap the `position: sticky` and related declaration in an `@supports` query as well:

```css
.sticky-container {
  @supports (container-type: scroll-state) {
	  position: sticky;
	  top: 0;
	  container-type: scroll-state;
	  container-name: section-header;
	  z-index: 10;
	}
}
```
**Tip:** If your "stuck" styling requires a different background color for readability, consider setting your layout up so that the default styling works everywhere (Progressive Enhancement). If you must use a fallback, you can gate the `position: sticky` behaviour itself inside an `@supports (container-type: scroll-state)` query.

If the visual transformation is absolutely critical to the design (e.g., the stuck state introduces a background or compaction without which the content is unreadable), you can implement a robust JavaScript fallback using `IntersectionObserver`. You must duplicate your CSS styles under an `.is-stuck` class. The following generic polyfill checks `getComputedStyle` to traverse up and find the correct scroll container (defaulting to the viewport), matching the behavior of `@container scroll-state(stuck: top)`:

```javascript
function getScrollParent(node) {
  if (node == null || node === document.body || node === document.documentElement) {
    return null; // default to viewport
  }
  if (node.scrollHeight > node.clientHeight || node.scrollWidth > node.clientWidth) {
    const overflow = getComputedStyle(node).overflow;
    if (overflow !== 'visible' && overflow !== 'clip') {
      return node;
    }
  }
  return getScrollParent(node.parentNode);
}

document.querySelectorAll('.sticky-container').forEach(container => {
  const root = getScrollParent(container);
  
  const topOffset = parseFloat(getComputedStyle(container).top) || 0;
  
  const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
    ([e]) => {
      // Toggle the fallback class on the sticky header container
      e.target.classList.toggle('is-stuck', e.intersectionRatio < 1);
    },
    { 
      root: root,
      threshold: [1],
      rootMargin: `-${topOffset + 1}px 0px 0px 0px` 
    }
  );
  
  observer.observe(container);
});
```

*Note: This generic IntersectionObserver pattern can also be used as a polyfill for the `scroll-state(scrollable)` query.*

# Responsive design

## Overall best practices

- Use `@container` queries to create component-driven responsive layouts that adapt to their parent container's size rather than the viewport. See `size-aware-styling` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "size-aware-styling"`) for more details.
- Use dynamic viewport units (`dvh`, `dvw`) instead of `vh`/`vw` to prevent layout breakage when mobile browser UI elements (like address bars) appear or disappear.
- Use `aspect-ratio` for media elements (like `<img>` and `<video>`) to reserve space during loading and prevent Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).

For the layout mechanics behind responsive UI (flexbox, grid, container query units, viewport units), see `css-layout` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "css-layout"`).

## Responsive typography

- **DO** combine viewport-relative and font-relative units in `clamp()` for font sizes that scale with the viewport size while ensuring they stay within a desired range. For example, `clamp(2rem, 1rem + 5vw, 4rem)`. Adjust the proportion of viewport-relative and font-relative units to control how quickly the font-size changes.
- **DON'T** use `vw` alone for font-size without `clamp()`, as it can scale text too small or too large on extreme screens.

To scale type and spacing with the container instead of the viewport, see `fluid-scaling` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "fluid-scaling"`).
